BookVerse CI inconsistencies vs bookverse-inventory (pending)

- Coverage output parity: bookverse-web and bookverse-helm lack a test-coverage step,
  so they cannot emit coverage_percent like inventory.
- Evidence steps: bookverse-helm disables chart evidence and build evidence.
- JFrog CLI version pinning in create-promote jobs: inventory pins
  jfrog/setup-jfrog-cli@v4 with version 2.88.0; other services may not.
- bookverse-infra checkout source: workflows reference both yonatanp-jfrog and
  tomjfrog for bookverse-infra; not standardized.
- Build info repo naming: some services set BUILD_INFO_REPO explicitly, others
  rely on defaults.
